Homework 2


Dear Professor Rogan,

This repository is a copy of your original Week 2 repository, modified slightly for homework 2.

CoinToss.py can be run as normal (I did have to change the import though, from "from python.Random" to "from Random". It now saves the results to a file "CoinToss_Results.txt"
This file is then accessed in CoinTossAnalysis, which can also be run as normal. It will now save two figures labelled figure 1 and figure 2
